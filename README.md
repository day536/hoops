I sought out to answer the following question:
1. What will Terance Mann’s market value next summer?

I project Terance Mann to be worth the following if he:
- Has an average season
- Has an above average season
- Blows up


Here's how I approached this problem:
- Market Value = expected production x demand for that production
- Teams estimate and pay for future contribution (over the course of the contract), but set this value based on information available at the time of the deal

I broke the main question down into three separate questions:
1. Which statistics/metrics best explain a player’s market value?
2. What is the market demand for these statistics/metrics?
3. What is Terrance Mann’s expected production in 2022 (specifically related to the statistics/metrics identified above)?
