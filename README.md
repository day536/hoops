I sought out to answer the following question:
1. What will Terance Mann’s market value next summer?

I project Terance Mann to be worth the following if he:
- Has an average season
- Has an above average season
- Blows up


Here's how I approached this problem:
- Market Value = expected production x demand for that production
- Teams estimate and pay for future contribution (over the course of the contract), but set this value based on information available at the time of the deal

I broke the main question down into three separate questions:
1. Which statistics/metrics best explain a player’s market value?
2. What is the market demand for these statistics/metrics?
3. What is Terrance Mann’s expected production in 2022 (specifically related to the statistics/metrics identified above)?



*1. Which statistics/metrics best explain a player’s market value?*
I first gathered all free agent signings since the 2016 free agency period. I then gathered seasonal player statistics for each season since the 2015-2016 season and combined these datasets.

The below plot shows the correlation matrix between average annual value (2022 cap-adjusted) and a player's regular season stats in the season leading up to the free agency contract.

Not surprisingly, some of the most correlated factors to salary are the more comprehensive metrics, such as Win Shares (WS), Offensive Box Plus-Minus (OBPM). Minutes-Per-Game (MPG) is also strongly correlated with average annual value of an ensuing free agent contract.




2. What is the market demand for these statistics/metrics?



3. What is Terrance Mann’s expected production in 2022 (specifically related to the statistics/metrics identified above)?

In the case of Terrance Mann, I wanted to refine my dataset based on a few factors:
1. Positional relevance: we should compare to other players who are expected to do similar things (position, type of stats/player). To do so, I refined my search to players with the following positions on basketball-reference.
2. Career relevance: we should compare statistics to other players with similar experience in the league. I ended up comparing Terance Mann's first two seasons to the career arc's of other players who entered the league since the 2013-14 season.

Using the statistics I identifed above as most related to average annual value of an ensuing free agent contract, I did some filtering and comparisons based on Terance Mann's production in Year 1 and Year 2.
